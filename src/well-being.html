                    <p>Pursuit of happiness accompany our lives from the very beginning, it is a genetic condition. Generally speaking your brain prefers to collect and store euphoric moments and when you are asked to summarise your life, you base your answer on them.</p>             

                    <p>Even though the state of happiness is one of the most subjective emotions and can be defined as a thousands of things, I strongly believe that overall happiness can be pre-engineered and is the key factor that contributes to your jolly well being. </p>

                    <p>It’s clear that everyone wants to be happy, but if you are not, then how to start the change and what to focus on first? 
                        The amount of scientific research, social media feed and life coaches advices can be overwhelming. To comprehend all that information, I employed my engineer mentality. 
                        To grasp a bigger picture of any complex topic, I break it down into the small understandable chunks to then encompass whole.
                        As you can guess I have used the same technique to better understand building blocks of my well-being.
                        
                        Using a powerful rule of 3 I have helped myself by breaking down base elements of my welfare into 3 pillars. 
                    </p>                        

                    <h2 class="section-heading">Pilar 1 - Your physical body.</h2>

                    <p>With a disciplined approach your body can be changed in a relatively short period of time, and what’s more important a healthy physical body for most people is a requirement to achieve full happiness. It will setup a great base for changing yourself and living full throttle on. 
                        Key components that contribute to your fit physical body are 
                        Physical Activity, 
                        your Diet 
                        and Sleep. 
                        Whereas even in divided world of science, most of researchers concur on benefits of a regular exercises and we all know that You are what you eat, that I suspect that our opinions on Sleep are not entirely uniform.
                        I have recently discovered that sleep seems to be an element in our life we forget to care about, partly because we underestimate the power of slumber and dangers coming from the sleep deprivation. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        For instance a link between sleeping siestas and the risk of heart diseases has been identified by scientists who studied 24 thousand Greek men and women.
                        Over the 6 years period they have discovered that:
                    </p>

                    <blockquote>Among the entire group, siestas of any duration or frequency were associated with a 34% lower risk of dying from heart disease.
                        <hr>
                        Among working men, occasional nappers were 64% less likely to die from coronary artery disease than their non-napping peers.
                    </blockquote>

                    <p>When I first heard about this research I was stunned. Do I sleep enough? Do you sleep enough? 
                        Since sleep is so important for any living being, as a homework, I will ask you to do a research on what the sleep hygiene is and how can sleep hygiene benefit your health. 
                    </p>

                    <h2 class="section-heading">Pilar 2 - Your emotional being</h2>

                    <p>Nowadays it seems like society and surrounding environment expects us to behave in a certain way. By blindly following a set of guidelines many of us feel a little bit lost. 
                        In order to gain back the control and emotional safety, try to align more, what you do, to who you are and who you want to be. 
                        
                        That shift can be very difficult, so count on people closest to you. In most cases people would love to support you only if you express yourself clearly enough.
                        I am going through that change at the moment, at this particular second and you are my friends helping me to be who I want to BE.
                        You have to decide, very intentionally, who you are going to be every single day. Once you start that transition, it is much easier to accept yourself and be accepted by the environment.
                        
                        If you are mad on the reality, don’t, accept it and then try to change it.
                        
                        How?
                        Relating to the Maslow’s pyramid of needs, I believe that physical body condition is a base that greatly contributes to a complete emotional satisfaction.
                        In most of the cases if you are healthy, you feel energetic, you are full of motivation, ready to take an action. You then often radiate outside, spreading positive vibe. So ensure that you charge your physical body enough and then start the change.

                    <span class="caption text-muted">Balance between each of the Pillars is crucial.</span>

                    <h2 class="section-heading">Pilar 3 - Your mental body</h2>

                    <p>Your mental being is a key element for thoughts becoming reality.
                        Based on my experience mental body can be enhanced in many different ways, like mindfulness or meditation. Although my favourite technique so far is a power of visualisation.
                        One of the easiest habits you can adapt daily is to write 3 - 5 realistic things you want to do each day. A trick here is that your subconscious mind will help to guide you through the day to achieve what you aimed for. The best aspect of that technique is its scalability. It means that you can use that technique to plan monthly or yearly and the chances that you will get what you want increase dramatically.
                        Jim Carry used to park on Mulholland drive every single night before he was famous, and wrote himself a check for 10 million dollars that he kept in his wallet. He gave himself three years to achieve his dream of being an actor, and remarkably, a check for that amount was written for his role in Dumb and Dumber three years later.
                    </p>

                    <h2 class="section-heading">Final words</h2>

                    <p>Your physical, emotional and mental bodies are very complex. With my introduction I have just scratched a peak of an iceberg, but I believe that the first step in any change is realization why it's worth. 
                        My advice is to start small, try to focus on and improve one area of your life at the time otherwise you might be at risk of sabotaging your efforts. 
                        Try with diet, by paying more attention to what you eat or maybe employ everyday sleep hygiene. 
                        I guarantee that you are going to witness how physical body satisfaction is going to help achieving better results in your emotional space, which then can directly relate to release of your mental potential, unlimited mental potential. 
                    </p>
