                    <blockquote>
                        “I have no special talents. I am only passionately curious.” 
                    </blockquote> Albert Einstein once said.               
                    <p>
                        Does that mean that everyone can be as successful as Albert Einstein was, only if we are passionately curious about the world? 
                        That has been a question circulating in my mind for some time and I believe that everyone can be a genius in one or more areas of life, although you need to be curious beyond any limits to achieve greatness. Is it difficult?
                        If you look at kids, you will observe that children show curiosity about everything. Sometimes to a level of annoyance, so that parents ignore or discourage that behaviour, instead of supporting it.
                        Were you passionately curious as Einstein at age 3, 4 or 5? Can you raise your hand if yes?
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        I think most of were even if we don’t remember that. It is enough to observe kids at that age now
                        Me too (I was the same), but I feel like the older we get we seem to gradually lose interest in asking very important questions - WHY? and HOW? 
                        We use to say “curiosity killed the cat”, right? That is rather a saying discouraging curiosity in my opinion.
                        We use it probably because we are too busy and too tired to repeatedly ask WHY? and HOW? 
                        I would like to change that and encourage everyone to start saying “curiosity sent man to the moon” it’s true, right? so why not?                        
                    </p>                        

                    <h2 class="section-heading">Curiosity & education</h2>

                    <p>
                        I grow up in Poland and I remember that for me and my peers main goal at school was passing grades. Performance level was depending on a personal ambition or parents influence. But at the end of a day it wasn’t about discovery, it was just about getting a grade. 
                        Can you relate to that? 
                        I know that educational system in UK is a bit different and encourages creativity a bit more. But how many of you were curious enough in school to dig deeper than you were expected to? or ask questions to genuinely listen to the answer? 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I wasn’t either.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I strongly believe that educational system in any country can be hugely improved by introducing programmes that encourage curiosity in students.

                    <h2 class="section-heading">Curiosity at workplace</h2>

                    <p>
                        So after education comes first job. I started mine as junior engineer during the last year of my university and I followed the same pattern as from since my early days at school. 
                        Learn a process, follow a process, don’t ask questions not related to a process. Fortunately because of my nature I quickly get bored with repetitive tasks, so I kept asking questions, although at that time I could be so easily discouraged from digging deeper. Around the same time I went to US for few months, met interesting people who actually were quite happily sharing their successful life stories. I believe that was a turning point for me, after which I started asking HOW? and WHY? again and again and again.
                        Once that became my habit, my professional career progress skyrocket. 
                        How? Curiosity at work can benefit in many ways, for example in fewer decision-making errors. How? When you are genuinely interested why someone is solving problem in a particular way you are less likely to fall into confirmation bias cage, meaning you are making less mistakes. If you make less mistakes than others, you get more recognition, you get to lead more challenging initiatives and then chain reaction continues.                
                    </p>

                    <h2 class="section-heading">Curiosity in life </h2>

                    <p>
                        Looking back I see that curiosity shaped who I am now and since very recently I have become even more curious, especially about things outside my profession. I started to analyse a lot of cases of cause and effect, understanding patterns in life, politics, history or economy. I also found enormous pleasure in learning and exploring new fields of science, finance or psychology. Being curious become my lifestyle and I am not being curious about what happens in 10th episode of Walking Dead, but more about Business Model Generation or enhancing my body energy levels through high quality sleep, intentional breathing or flow state as gate to hyperproductivity. 
                    </p>

                    <h2 class="section-heading">My pleasure of being curious</h2>

                    <p>
                        That is a huge change for me as I feel like for most of my life I was living as a follower. Following ideas, often blindly accepting incoming information. Now I know that in the times of fake news, informational noise and media manipulation, being conscious is what helps you to maintain your freedom. And I belive you more conscious when you are curious.
                        As a summary, I would like to share the main reasons why I love to be curious. I believe you also can benefit from curiosity in a similar way and much beyond.
                        
                        <li>the first one is - It’s amusing and process of discovery brings so much pleasure</li> 
                        <li>It can significantly accelerate your professional career development, or even change it because you will actually find what you really love doing</li>
                        <li>Last but not least - You can help people around you, by being advisor because you know a lot</li>

                    </p>
                    <blockquote>
                        “The important thing is not to stop questioning. Curiosity has its own reason for existence. One cannot help but be in awe when he contemplates the mysteries of eternity, of life, of the marvelous structure of reality. It is enough if one tries merely to comprehend a little of this mystery each day.” - Albert Einstein
